      <h2>Welcome to Simba Sports Club</h2>
      <p> Simba Sports Club is a Tanzanian football club based in Dar es Salaam. Their home games are played at two stadiums Uhuru Stadium and National Stadium. Simba SC is one of two biggestfootball clubs in Tanzania, their archrivals being the Young Africans. The club had several names during its history, when it was founded in 1936 it was called Queens, then changed to Eagles, Dar Sunderland and later, in 1971 changed to its current name, Simba (that means Lion in Swahili).
        The highest level of success that Simba SC achieved was getting to the final of the CAF Cup in 1993 where they lost to Stella Abidjan of CÃ´te d'Ivoire. It was the highest achievement on continental competitions reached by any Tanzanian team. One of the most memorable years for the club was 2003 when it knocked off the then reign champions Egyptian giants Zamalek on its way to qualify for the group stages of the CAF Champions League. In the first round of that year's competition, Simba SC eliminated Santos of South Africa.</p>
